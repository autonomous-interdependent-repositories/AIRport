# moving-walkway

A moving walkway is a slow-moving conveyor mechanism that transports people across a horizontal 
or inclined plane over a short to medium distance.  It a sharded version of the guideway schema.  
Development work was been frozen and would resume if the non-sharded version proves 
to be not feasible.
