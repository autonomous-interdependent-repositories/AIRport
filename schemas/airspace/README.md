# Airspace

# TODO: add @Api() interfaces

## Why the name 

"Controlled airspace is found around some airports and at 
certain altitudes where air traffic controllers are 
actively communicating with, directing, and separating 
all air traffic."

@airport/airspace defines the schema for storing schemas themselves.

## Description

Stores application schema (and API) definitions.  To be used
to retrieve schema definitions in off-line scenarios, where an
 App relies on other App schemas and those app schemas are not
avialable over the network.
