# Tower

The tower is a tall, windowed structure located on the airport grounds.
The primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is
visual observation from the airport control tower.

In AIRport the "tower" library is used to host schema logic in isolated
processes (either in V8 isolates in a think client or in different 
subdomain iframes, with web-tower library).
