## Why the name 

"Airband or aircraft band is the name for a group of frequencies in the VHF radio spectrum allocated to radio communication in civil aviation."

@airport/vhf-radio connects AIRport clients and AIRport across tabs.

## Description

Cross tab communication in browser.  Automatically included as a hidden IFrame in
Clients.  Runs on the same domain as AIRport and thus is able to communicate with it
(if it runs in a different, shared tab).
