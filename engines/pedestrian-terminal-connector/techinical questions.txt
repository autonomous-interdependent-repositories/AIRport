1)  Verify that LEFT OUTER JOIN queries can be performed across:
USER_REPOSITORIES
REPOSITORY_DATABASES
DATABASE_REPOSITORIES

2)  Shard splitting

When a shard gets split all of it's databases and related repositories get moved
to a new shard.  In the original shard databases get marked as moved to the new
shard.

When a device that belongs to a split shard connects to the original shard one of
two things can happen:

a)  Original shard responds back saying that the device needs to connect to the
split shard.  The device then connects to the new shard on the next tick.

b)  Original shard forwards the request to the split shard and the client gets
the response on the same tick (with a slight delay).

Second approach is preferred though requires a bit more coding.  Servers can
communicate between each other more efficiently than a client (no wireless link,
dedicated backbone, possibly in the same data center).  For a client that's been
offline for a long time and missed a number of shard splits the connection could
get bounced across multiple shard servers.  Alternatively, when a shard re-split
happens, the original shards Database record can be update to reflect the final
shard location for that database.
