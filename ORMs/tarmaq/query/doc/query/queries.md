## Summary

There are two classes of queries, Entity and Non-Entity

## Entity Queries

Entity queries return results that map to Entities.  There are two types of Entity queries:

- [Entity Graph Query](./query_types/entity_graph_query.md)
- [Entity Tree Query](./query_types/entity_tree_query.md)

## Non-Entity Queries

Queries that don't return results which belong to a particular entity are Non-Entity queries. There are three types of Non-Entity queries:

- Non-Entity Tree Query - gets a flat tree of objects that don't directly map to entities
- [Field Query](./query_types/field_query.md)
- [Sheet Query](./query_types/sheet_query.md)
